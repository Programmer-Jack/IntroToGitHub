Version control is software that allows a developer to keep a history of updates to a project, safely test new changes by creating a new branch and later pushing the changes to the main branch, and collaborating on the code with other developers.

### And how about a code sample?
```
// .NET 8.0
// Assume class container and proper using namespaces are present

private float GetProductivity(int caffeineMilligrams) => Math.Pow(Math.e, (float)caffeineMilligrams);

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int caffeinemg = 100;
    Console.WriteLine(GetProductivity(caffeinemg));
}
```
Works for me. [^1]

[^1]: Kinda.
